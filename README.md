# Advanced-CSS-Portfolio

## Description

The purpose behind this project was to put my CSS knowledge into action and to create a portfolio for future employers to view during the hiring process. It is an application I would be able to attach to my resume which would showcase my work as a developer. Throughout creating this web application, I further advanced my knowledge in CSS and applied what I have learned so far.
